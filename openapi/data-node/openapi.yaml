    The OpenAPI specification implemented by NLP Sandbox Data Nodes.

    # Overview

    A NLP Sandbox Data Node is a repository of clinical notes that implements
    this OpenAPI specification so that other services in the NLP Sandbox
    ecosystem can access them. For example, a client requests data from a Data
    Node before passing them as input to an NLP Tool like a Date Annotator,
    Person Name Annotator, etc.

    For the sake of benchmarking NLP Tool, a Data Node can also give access to
    the gold standard that the NLP Tool is expected to infer (e.g. annotations).
